My name is Suubi Lubaale. I am self-driven and a great team worker. I enjoy identifying and analyzing security risks and threats, moreover, I love reading more on new and emerging security risks and threats and this helps to ensure the long-term security of not only organizations but also individuals from threat actors and risks that mitigates data and privacy breaches.
